# Multi-Package Repository - Learning React from Scratch

This is a multi-package repository where I'll be learning React from scratch.

### What you'll find here:
- Projects and exercises as I dive deeper into React.
- Each project or topic will be organized in its own folder for easy navigation.

### Goal:
To learn and practice React through hands-on projects and examples that will help me understand the basics and beyond.

Thanks for checking it out!
